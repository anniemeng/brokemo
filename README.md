# Brokemo

We love Venmo, and how easy it makes paying people back without constantly harassing our friends. But sometimes, we're either too broke to pay people back, or know it'll all balance out in the long run. So we decided to create an app that lets you pay people back in 3 different forms without direct cash transfer: smiles, dinner and chores. 
To get a payment verified, you would have to take a picture of the activity and have it confirmed by the charger. 
With Facebook login, you can make transactions easily with your Facebook friends!
